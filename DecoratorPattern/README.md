# Decorator Pattern


In object-oriented programming, the decorator pattern is a design pattern
that allows behavior to be added to an individual object, dynamically,
without affecting the behavior of other objects from the same class.

The decorator pattern is often useful for adhering to the Single 
Responsibility Principle, as it allows functionality to be divided between 
classes with unique areas of concern.

Decorator use can be more efficient than subclassing, because an object's 
behavior can be augmented without defining an entirely new object.
