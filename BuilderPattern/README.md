# Builder Pattern


The builder pattern is a design pattern designed to provide a flexible 
solution to various object creation problems in object-oriented 
programming. 

The intent of the Builder design pattern is to separate the construction 
of a complex object from its representation. It is one of the Gang of Four 
design patterns.
