# Bridge Pattern


The bridge pattern is a design pattern used in software engineering that is 
meant to "decouple an abstraction from its implementation so that the two
can vary independently", introduced by the Gang of Four.

The bridge uses encapsulation, aggregation, and can use inheritance to 
separate responsibilities into different classes.
