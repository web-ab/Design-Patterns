# Template Pattern


In object-oriented programming, the template method is one of the behavioral
design patterns identified by Gamma et al.
in the book Design Patterns. 

The template method is a method in a superclass, usually an abstract superclass,
and defines the skeleton of an operation in terms of a number of high-level steps. 
These steps are themselves implemented by additional helper methods in the same class as the template method.
