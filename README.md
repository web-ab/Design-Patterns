# What is design pattern ?


A design pattern is a repeatable solution to a software engineering
problem. Unlike most program-specific solutions, design patterns are used
in many programs. Design patterns are not considered finished product,
rather, they are templates that can be applied to multiple situations and 
can be improved over time, making a very robust software engineering tool. 
Because development speed is increased when using a proven prototype,
developers using design pattern templates can improve coding efficiency and 
final product readability.
